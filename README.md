<h1 style = "font-family: Arial"> Motivation </h1>
<p>From <strong>high-school</strong> to <strong>university classes</strong>, Physics instructors try their best to help students visualize conceptually heavy scenarios. Not all instructors succeed in doing so because of the lack of actual visuals. Moreover, when examples become impractical to demo in-class, students beign to suffer more. This is especially true for one of the most foundational elementary dynamics situation: A point-mass travelling around a vertical loop with constant speed. This example is intended to illustrate how the properities of an object in uniform circular motion change during motion, such as the magnitude of the normal force on the point-mass. Although, it is not uncommon for students to come out of lectures being confused by this example. Thus, consider...</p>
