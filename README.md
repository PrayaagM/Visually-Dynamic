<h1 style = "font-family: Arial"> Motivation </h1>
<h7 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">From <strong>high-school</strong> to <strong>university classes</strong>, Physics instructors try their best to help students visualize conceptually heavy scenarios. Not all instructors succeed in doing so because of the lack of actual visuals. Moreover, when examples become impractical to demo in-class, students beign to suffer more. This is especially true for one of the most foundational elementary dynamics situation: A point-mass travelling around a vertical loop with constant speed. This example is intended to illustrate how the properities of an object in uniform circular motion change during motion, such as the magnitude of the normal force on the point-mass. Although, it is not uncommon for students to come out of lectures being confused by this example. Thus, consider...</h7>

<h7 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">Visually allows the user to modify the mass with a slider, and modify the velocities 
    (linear and angular) of the point mass. Moreover, the web-app provides the magnitudes 
    of all forces acting on the point mass, as well as the angle from the vertical to the 
    point mass. This is all included to help the user better understand how a point-mass 
    travels around a vertical loop! With the information provided, the web-app intuitively 
    showcases how the centripetal force that the mass requires is formed!

<h1 style = "font-family: Arial"> Technologies </h1>
<h7 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">
    Visually is made using the Processing foundationâ€™s 
    generative art JavaScript library, p5.js, as well as some basic HTML and CSS.

<h1 style = "font-family: Arial"> Inspiration </h1>
<h7 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">
    I developed this project purely out of the interest to see if I was able to create a tool
    which can help others understand important concepts that they otherwise may gloss over. After
    developing this project, I provided it to my high school physics teacher and first-year physics
    professor at UW to use it as a demo for whenever they discuss this scenario.
</h7>

<h1 style = "font-family: Arial"> Future Developments: </h1>
<h3 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">There are two very obvious routes for future development: increase more functionality in terms of physics, and make the web-application more stylish.</h3>

<h7 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">
    In terms of adding more applications concerning physics, a natural next-step would be to
    consider situations involving tangential acceleration (i.e., non-uniform circular motion). 
    Moreover, the user could be promoted to choose which type of object they would like to see
    travel around the loop. That is, choose a point-mass, or an object with a moment of inertia,
    such as a hoop, a sphere, a cylinder, or various other possibilities.
</h7><br>
<h7 style = "font-family : Arial Narrow;">
    In terms of future design plans, I already aim to make the application more aesthetically
    pleasing via generative art backgrounds with more p5.js. Furthermore, reconsidering the layout
    of the application to provide the user with a better interface is definitely up there on the
    to-do list.
